I can help you with additional considerations for deploying your PDF storing and testing application to a VPS like Hostinger. Here are some important steps and best practices to follow:

## VPS Deployment Guide

### 1. Server Setup
```bash
# Update your server
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Install PM2 for process management
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

### 2. Domain and SSL Configuration
```bash
# Install Nginx as a reverse proxy
sudo apt install nginx -y

# Install Certbot for SSL
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Application Deployment

For your backend:
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/sarnick005/pdf-storing-testing.git
cd pdf-storing-testing/server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start with PM2
pm2 start dist/index.js --name "pdf-backend"
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

For your frontend:
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run build

# Move build files to Nginx's serving directory
sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/yourdomain.com/
```

### 4. Nginx Configuration

Create a config file for your application:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/pdf-app
```

Add this configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # SSL configuration (Certbot will modify this part)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Frontend
    location / {
        root /var/www/yourdomain.com;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Backend API
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;  # Adjust port to match your backend
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Enable the configuration:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pdf-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 5. Database Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Install MongoDB or PostgreSQL based on your project requirements
# For MongoDB:
sudo apt install -y mongodb

# For PostgreSQL:
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### 6. Firewall Configuration
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw enable
```

### 7. Continuous Deployment (Optional)
You might want to set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar:

1. Create deployment keys
2. Set up webhook or scheduled pull
3. Automate build and restart processes

### 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
```bash
# Set up log rotation
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/pdf-app

# Monitor application with PM2
pm2 monit

# Set up automated backups
# For database, config files, and uploads
```

### 9. Specific Hostinger Considerations

If using Hostinger's VPS:
- Access your VPS through the control panel
- Note that some VPS plans might require additional configuration for SSH access
- Follow Hostinger's specific documentation for DNS configuration

Remember to update your frontend environment variables to point to your production backend API URL before building the frontend application.
